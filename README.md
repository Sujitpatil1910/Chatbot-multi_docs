# Chatbot-multi_docs
This project uses advanced AI models like LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3 to create a smart chatbot that extracts and understands information from PDFs. It converts PDFs into text, cleans the data, fine-tunes the AI model, and uses the Replicate API for easy access. The chatbot provides quick and accurate answers, making information easier to find and use.
